@article{Goldstein2004,
  abstract = {The electrolarynx (EL) voice prosthesis is widely used, but suffers from the inconvenience of requiring manual control. Therefore, a hands-free EL triggered by neck muscle electromyographic (EMG) activity was developed (EMG-EL). Signal processing circuitry in a belt-mounted control unit transforms EMG activity into control signals for initiation and termination of voicing. These control signals are then fed to an EL held against the neck by an inconspicuous brace. Performance of the EMG-EL was evaluated by comparison to normal voice, manual EL voice, and tracheo-esophageal (TE) voice in a series of reaction time experiments in seven normal subjects and one laryngectomy patient. The normal subjects produced voice initiation with the EMG-EL that was as fast as both normal voice and the manual EL. The laryngectomy subject produced voice initiation that was slower than with the manual EL, but faster than with TE voice. Voice termination with the EMG-EL was slower than normal voice for the normal subjects, but not significantly different than with the manual EL. The laryngectomy subject produced voice termination with the EMG-EL that was slower than with TE or manual EL. The EMG-EL threshold was set at 10\% of the range of vocal-related EMG activity above baseline. Simulations of EMG-EL behavior showed that the 10\% threshold was not significantly different from the optimum threshold produced through the process of error minimization. The EMG-EL voice reaction time appears to be adequate for use in a day-to-day conversation.},

@article{Leunisse2001,
  abstract = {After total laryngectomy, voice can be restored with a silicone rubber tracheoesophageal voice prosthesis. However, biofilm formation and subsequent deterioration of the silicone material of the prosthesis will limit device life by impairing valve function. To simulate the natural process of biofilm development under dynamic nutrient conditions, a modified Robbins device was used to evaluate the biofilm-related valve dysfunction of the Groningen, Provox2, Blom-Singer indwelling, and VoiceMaster voice prostheses. Obstruction of the semicircular slit-valved Groningen prosthesis leading to increased airway resistance was caused not only by a buildup of deposits on the esophageal flange and valve hat, but also by accumulation of deposits on the semicircular valve seating. The hinged flap valved Provox2 and indwelling Blom-Singer prostheses failed to close sufficiently because of biofilm formation on the valve seating. The esophageal flange of the VoiceMaster prosthesis was affected, but the tripod structure of the ball valve was fully colonized up to the titanium sleeve, which interfered with proper valve opening and closure. These findings on biofilm formation could be used for the further development and modification of critical design features of voice prostheses to facilitate tracheoesophageal speech.},

  abstract = {Patients of laryngeal cancer who have undergone the surgical removal of the entire larynx suffer the loss of phonation. Electrolarynx (EL) speech is the most commonly adopted alaryngeal phonation. However, EL speech is notorious of the sound quality being monotonic and robotic with the lack of pitch control and the presence of the radiated noise. This paper provides a review of modalities in EL speech as well as introducing the technologies to control the pitch and reduce the noise of the device.},

  abstract = {The electrolarynx provides a valuable means of verbal communication for people who cannot use their natural voice-production mechanism, but technology has changed very little since it was introduced in the 1950s. The presence of background noise degrades the resulting speech. In this study background noise was reduced by a new method, independent component analysis-based adaptive noise cancelling, which can remove noise components of the primary input signal based on statistical independence, by incorporating both second-order and higher-order statistics. The method shows better performance than the conventional least mean square algorithm. Acoustic analysis of the denoised electrolarynx speech revealed a significant reduction in the amount of background noise. Results from the perceptual evaluations indicated that the new filtering technique produced a noticeable improvement in the acceptability of the electrolarynx speech in a quiet environment (from 1.75 to 2.49, arbitrary units) or a noisy environment (from 0.59 to 1.82). In general, there was no significant improvement or degradation in intelligibility in the quiet environment (from 52.7 to 53.3). However, the processing did improve the intelligibility in a babble-noise environment (from 24.9 to 40.6). The improvement in acceptability and intelligibility may increase the communication ability of the user in daily situations.},
